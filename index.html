      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. Phonics</td>
        <td>Introduce phonics, which is the relationship between letters and their sounds. Teach your child to sound out words using the letters they know.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. Vocabulary</td>

      <tr>
        <td>4. Sight Words</td>
        <td>Teach your child to recognize commonly used words by sight. These words cannot be easily sounded out.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5. Comprehension</td>
        <td>Encourage your child to understand what they are reading by asking questions about the story, characters, and events. Discuss the main idea, setting, and plot.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6. Practice</td>
        <td>Encourage your child to read every day. Start with short stories and gradually increase length and complexity. Provide positive reinforcement and praise.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7. Read Aloud</td>
        <td>Read aloud to your child to improve listening skills, expose them to different types of literature, and encourage a love of reading.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>8. Patience</td>
        <td>Learning to read takes time, patience, and practice. Each child learns at their own pace, so be patient and supportive.</td>
