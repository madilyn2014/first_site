    <title>Texas Rap Song</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Texas Rap Song</h1>
    <p>Verse 1:</p>
    <p>Deep in the heart of Texas, the Lone Star State,</p>
    <p>Where the sun shines bright, it's never too late.</p>
    <p>From the Gulf of Mexico to the Panhandle plains,</p>
    <p>Everything is bigger here, that's just how we maintain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Chorus:</p>
    <p>Texas, oh Texas, where the cowboys roam,</p>
    <p>The land of oil, cattle, and a place we call home.</p>
    <p>From Houston to Dallas, San Antonio to Austin,</p>
    <p>We'll always rep the Lone Star, never stopping or pausing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Verse 2:</p>
    <p>In the land of the Alamo, we hold our heads up high,</p>
    <p>Where history is made, and heroes never die.</p>
    <p>From the dusty trails to the city streets,</p>
    <p>The rhythm of Texas is hard to beat.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Chorus:</p>
    <p>Texas, oh Texas, where the cowboys roam,</p>
    <p>The land of oil, cattle, and a place we call home.</p>
    <p>From Houston to Dallas, San Antonio to Austin,</p>
    <p>We'll always rep the Lone Star, never stopping or pausing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Verse 3:</p>
    <p>The football fields are fierce, the music scene is hot,</p>
    <p>The BBQ is smoking, and the people are not.</p>
    <p>We got southern hospitality, it's just how we roll,</p>
    <p>From the plains to the coast, we got heart and soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Chorus:</p>
    <p>Texas, oh Texas, where the cowboys roam,</p>
    <p>The land of oil, cattle, and a place we call home.</p>
    <p>From Houston to Dallas, San Antonio to Austin,</p>
    <p>We'll always rep the Lone Star, never stopping or pausing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Outro:</p>
    <p>So come on down and join us, we'll show you a good time,</p>
    <p>In the land of the free, where the stars always shine.</p>
    <p>From the Red River to the Rio Grande,</p>
    <p>We'll always be proud of our Texas land.</p>
